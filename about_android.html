      <h2>LesS/KEY for Android</h2>
      <p> LesS/KEY is a passwort generation and management tool based on S/KEY.</p>
      </p>Features:
          <ul>
            <li><p>The generated passwords (called 'keys' below) are strong but easy to remember.</p></li>
            <li><p>The keys can be (re)generated at any time and on any device (without having to sync a file).</p></li>
            <li><p>The keys (and your master password) are not stored and not sent anywhere.</p></li>
          </ul>
      </p>
      <h3>How to use it (basic usage)</h3>
        <ol>
          <li><p>Enter a name for the account you wish to create a password for into the 'seed' field (e. g. 'amazon' or 'github.com').</p></li>
          <li><p>Enter your master password into the first 'secret' field (optionally also into the second one, for verification) and tap 'calculate'.</p>
              <p>The generated keys are invisible. Tapping 'show' makes them visible, but that's optional.</p></li>
          <li><p>Double-tap a key to copy it to the clipboard, or select it first and then tap 'copy'.</p></li>
        </ol>
